## ‚òï Chatbot_Coffee-shop: Chatbot Deployment with Flask and JavaScript

Welcome to the **Chatbot_Coffee-shop** project! This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a chatbot using **Flask** and **JavaScript**, offering two flexible deployment options. Enhance customer experience at your coffee shop by integrating this intelligent conversational assistant into your web application.

### üîç Project Overview

This project guides you through building and deploying a chatbot tailored for a coffee shop environment. Using Flask for backend support and JavaScript for frontend integration, the chatbot responds to user queries, enhancing engagement and streamlining customer interactions.

**Deployment Options**:
1. **Within Flask App**: Use a Jinja2 template for easy deployment within Flask.
2. **Standalone API**: Serve the Flask prediction API, allowing integration into any frontend application with minimal modifications.

### üéØ Objective

To deploy a smart and interactive chatbot for a coffee shop, helping customers with:
- Ordering menu items.
- Answering queries about store timings, offers, and more.
- Enhancing user engagement and service efficiency.

### üî¨ Key Insights and Features

1. **Customizable Responses**: Modify `intents.json` to tailor the chatbot‚Äôs behavior for your business needs.
2. **API-Driven Approach**: Serve Flask's prediction API as a standalone service, allowing integration into external frontend applications.
3. **Interactive Conversations**: Users can engage in meaningful conversations with the chatbot, increasing retention and satisfaction.
4. **AI-Powered Understanding**: Leverages NLP techniques for accurate intent recognition and context-aware responses.

### üîß Tools and Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Backend development and API serving.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend integration for dynamic chatbot interactions.
- **PyTorch**: For training the chatbot‚Äôs deep learning model.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
- **HTML & CSS**: To design and style the chatbot interface.

### üî¶ Project Learning

- Gained proficiency in **Flask app development** and serving RESTful APIs.
- Mastered training a chatbot using **PyTorch** and managing model data (`data.pth`).
- Explored **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with `nltk` for tokenization.
- Learned to seamlessly integrate Flask APIs with JavaScript for responsive user interfaces.
- Built scalable and reusable components for deployment in any frontend application.

### üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

#### Step 1 Clone the Repository and Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shashi699/Chatbot_Coffee-shop.git
$ cd chatbot-deployment
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
$ (venv) pip install Flask torch torchvision nltk
```

#### Step 3: Download NLTK Package
```python
$ (venv) python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```

#### Step 4: Customize `intents.json`
Modify the `intents.json` file with your coffee shop's intents and responses.

#### Step 5: Train the Chatbot
```bash
$ (venv) python train.py
```

#### Step 6: Test the Chatbot Locally
```bash
$ (venv) python chat.py
```

#### Step 7: Deploy Using `app.py` and `app.js`
Follow the tutorial steps to implement `app.py` for backend and `app.js` for frontend interaction.
